# The [Parsonizer](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsonizer/)

Parsons problems are designed to help you study snippets of code without getting bogged down in errors and syntax.  Simply paste in the code you want to study, and the parsonizer will shuffle the lines.  Your task is to place them in order.  But it's not always as easy as it sounds!  Beware of indenting (code style) and extra lines.

When you find a particularly interesting example of JavaScript syntax, design pattern, solution strategy, copy paste it into [this web page](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsonizer/) to study it in depth as a parsons problem.

Parsons problems are a great way to practice syntax, logical strategies, and programming design patterns.
